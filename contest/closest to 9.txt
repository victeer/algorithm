描述
Given N arithmetic expressions, can you tell whose result is closest to 9?

输入
Line 1: N (1 <= N <= 50000).
Line 2..N+1: Each line contains an expression in the format of "a op b" where a, b are integers (-10000 <= a, b <= 10000) and op is one of addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/). There is no "divided by zero" expression.


输出
The index of expression whose result is closest to 9. If there are more than one such expressions, output the smallest index.
